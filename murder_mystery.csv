1,"It's the early hours of the morning: cold wet, and the mud gets everywhere as you trudge through it. [Haynes]""I see him, he's over there."" Haynes, your partner, says, shining his torch at something in the distance. You can't quite make it out, against the glare of the torch on the walls of Barnard castle. As you approach, a figure comes into view: a man, standing in a yellow raincoat, and something on the ground.",Check the time,Ask what happened,Ask who Karl is,2,3,4

3,"[Karl]""I don't know, except for that I found him 20 minutes ago now. I heard some noise earlier. Well, actually I heard a few noises, more like bangs, but I was tired - so can't remember exactly. I walk out, see someone outside, so I follow them. They don't move much, and that's when I realise this guy wasn't alive. I haven't touched him or anything - just called the police.""",Ask to look at the body,Search around the body,5,6,,
4,"[Karl]""Oh, er, Karl Smith. I live locally, I don't have any official business here. I just like to watch over the green.""",Ask to look at the body,Search around the body,5,6,,
5,"You turn your eyes to the ground. There's not much to make out - the mud covers most of it. There might be blood, but it's so covered by the dirt that it all looks the same. The clothing must be dark, and looks like there's a coat and dark trousers. He is at the base of the castle wall, and his limbs are spread out, as if he'd fallen from a height.",Ask for any other remarks,Ask if he could have fallen,7,8,,
6,"You move the torch around the body, finding nothing - except for when a silver object flashes back. It's a torch on the ground. [Player]""This yours?"" You ask both men. They shake their heads. [Player]""Ok, well we won't touch it.""You can see behind you more officers arriving.",Ask for any other remarks,Ask if he could have fallen,7,8,,
7,"[Karl]""Now that I think about it, I did hear some shouting for a few minutes after the first noise. Not sure, though."" Karl says. The others are arriving now.

9,"The drive to the station doesn't take long, and Haynes is silent for most of it. You walk up the stairs quickly, and enter your office. [Player]'Alright, so what have we got?' You ask Haynes. He replies, writing on a whiteboard as he speaks: [Haynes]""So. Profile. Middle-aged. White male. Blond hair, no glasses. Location of death, Barnard castle, on the green. Injury unknown yet. Possible causes of death...""",Suggest natural causes,Suggest he fell from the wall,State he died from blunt force trauma,10,11,12
10,"Haynes gives you a look, as if to ask if you are serious. Nevertheless, he adds it to the list. [Haynes]""Right. Any better ideas?""",Suggest he fell from the wall,State he died from blunt force trauma,11,12,,
11,"[Haynes]""I think he was in the right position for it. We'll have to wait for forensics though to confirm though."" Haynes replies. You look at the whiteboard. It's not exactly full. [Player]""Well, let's see where we are after interviewing the neighbours. Time?""[Haynes] ""6:45 AM"". [Player]""Ok, give it a few hours, then weï'll head out.""",Wait for a few hours,13,,,,
12,"[Haynes]""Could be - but I didn't see any tracks leading away."" Haynes says. [Haynes]""Well, I didn't see ours either, between the mud and the dark."" You reply. You look at the whiteboard. It's not exactly full. [Player]""Well, let's see where we are after interviewing the neighbours. Time?""[Haynes] ""6:45"". [Player]""Ok, give it a few hours, then we'll head out.""",Wait for a few hours,13,,,,
13,"With the sun fully up, there's a lot more people out as you drive through the streets. You stop at a row of houses, just over the road from the castle. [Player""Ok, we'll check these first."" You say to Haynes. You get out, and look at the first few houses. Number 13 has a very nicely decorated driveway, plenty of plantlife and a few baskets on the doorstep, but no car. 14 has two hatchbacks, and you can hear talking inside. 15 is not very decorated, and has a sedan outside. 16 has a Ford Focus, and a well-looked after paved driveway. You walk up to number 14 and reach for the doorbell - without warning it opens suddenly.",,,,,,
